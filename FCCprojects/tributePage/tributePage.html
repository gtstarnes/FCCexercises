                <h2>Timeline of Plotinus's life and ideas</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>He was born in the year 205CE in Lyco, Egypt.</li>
                    <li>He is believed to be Greek, as he was raised in the Greek tradition, spoke Greek, and recieved a Greek education.</li>
                    <li>He had a distrust in the physical world, believing it to be a poor mimicry of a higher, nonphysical reality.</li>
                    <li>As a result, he never wanted a portait (painting or bust) of himself made.</li>
                    <li>In the year 232 CE, he travelled to Alexandria to study philosophy.</li>
                    <li>He disliked every teacher he came into contact with until he heard Ammonius Saccas lecture. He promptly became Ammonius Saccas's student.</li>
                    <li>He studied in Alexandria for 11 years. Eventually he developed a interest in the philsophy of the Persians.</li>
                    <li>So, in 243 CE, he joined Gordian III's military campaign in Persia to get some exposure to their philosohy.</li>
                    <li>The campiagn was a failure, and he was ultimately trapped in Persia and had to negotiate he way back to the Roman Empire.</li>
                    <li>At the age of 40, he moved to Rome, where he stayed for the rest of his life teaching philsophy.</li>
                    <li>Some of his students include: Porphyry, Eustochius, and Castricuius Firmus.</li>
